Introduction

   Conventions are important to keep the project consistent.

Code style

    TODO: none yet, this has to be thoroughly discussed on the developer list:
    Sun code conventions??? What is Spring doing?

Build process

    * All versions should be specified in the project root pom.xml: never in a child pom.

Documentation

    * All apt/fml/xdoc files should be in camelCase starting with a low letter.
